# Reliance_Sales_Store_Analysis
 Problem Statement
In a competitive retail environment, Reliance Smart Store faces challenges in optimizing inventory, enhancing customer satisfaction, and maximizing revenue across diverse product categories. Despite having access to rich transactional data, the store lacks a structured analytical framework to extract actionable insights on customer behavior, product performance, and operational efficiency.

# This project aims to leverage SQL-based data analysis to:
- Identify sales trends, peak purchase timings, and preferred payment methods.
- Detect high-performing and underperforming products based on delivery and cancellation rates.
- Segment customers by age and gender to uncover targeted marketing opportunities.
- Evaluate category-wise revenue contribution and return patterns to guide strategic investments.
- Improve customer experience by reducing cancellations and streamlining payment processes.
By transforming raw sales data into meaningful business intelligence, this project empowers Reliance Smart Store to make data-driven decisions that enhance profitability, customer trust, and operational agility.
